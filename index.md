## Research and Methodology Statement

Using computational and statistical methods (including: signal processing, machine learning, regression analysis, object-oriented programming,
and data wrangling) to scrutinize the link between observed cloud dynamical processes and coupled microphysical response to infer principles for 
process level prediction and compare against state-of-the-art atmospheric model predictions.

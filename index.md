## Research and Methodology Statement

Using computational and statistical methods (including: signal processing, machine learning, regression analysis, object-oriented programming,
and data wrangling) to scrutinize the link between observed cloud dynamical processes and coupled microphysical response, infering principles for 
process level prediction and comparing against state-of-the-art atmospheric model simulations.
